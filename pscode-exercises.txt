// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)
number a + number b == number c
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
if number c is divided by 2 and answer == integer, answer = even
if number c is divided by 2 and answer == float, answer = odd
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
number a = 1 
number b = 2 
number c = 3 
number d = 4 
number e = 5
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 == 15 15 / 5 == 3
number a < number b
number b < number c
number c < number d
number d < number e

I think I assigned variables to integers.
Then I did simple math to determine the average of the 5 numbers.
Then I established that each number was smaller than the number that came after, though I don't know how I would calculate that yet in a command prompt. Maybe if I added each number to itself to find the highest and lowest values?

Example 

a + a =
b + b = 
c + c =
d + d =
e + e =
?
